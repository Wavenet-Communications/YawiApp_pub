# YawiApp (React Native)
Lost and find application

YAWi app was made to help you find the things that matter most! When you activate the tracker and attached it to a thing(or item), the YAWi App discovers and establishes a connection to it using your device's Bluetooth signal. Once a Bluetooth connection is made between your tracker and 'YAWi App', can be used for two way finding communication.
